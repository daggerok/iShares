# iShares

iShares ETF holdings to Watchlist. A single-file client-side tool that reads the generated `./api/ishares` static feed (iShares Data Download SpreadsheetML (.xls) exports, Yahoo Finance history) into a searchable ETF/asset-class catalog with per-fund tabs, watchlist aggregation, ticker copy and CSV/TXT export — the same look, feel, columns and business logic as the sibling applications.

## Using Bun

```bash
bunx degit daggerok/iShares#main ./12345 && cd $_
bunx serve . -p 1234
open http://0:1234
```

The published application is available at <https://daggerok.github.io/iShares/>.

## Updating the static iShares data

Run the updater with Bun:

```bash
bun test scripts/update-data.test.ts
./scripts/update-data.ts
```

Run `./scripts/update-data.ts -h` (or `--help`) to print every configuration variable with its default and usage examples.

The **Update iShares ETF data** GitHub Actions workflow exposes the same settings as manual inputs. All supplied filters use **AND** logic.

### Data sources

| Block | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Catalog (all US iShares ETFs) | `https://www.ishares.com/us/products/etf-product-list/1524258966511.ajax?fileName=productView&fileType=xls` (iShares product list XLS) |
| Holdings per fund | `https://www.ishares.com/us/products/{TICKER}/1467271812596.ajax?fileName={TICKER}_holdings&fileType=xls` (per-fund holdings XLS) |
| Daily history, distributions | Yahoo Finance chart API for price history |
| Fallback | Previously published `api/ishares/index.json` as catalog fallback |

Each fund carries a derived `metrics` object that powers the catalog columns shared with the sibling sites:

- `ytd` / `tr1y` — official YTD and 1-year returns → *YTD Return*, *TR 1Y*
- `cagr3y` / `cagr5y` / `cagr10y` — published annualized 3Y/5Y/10Y figures → *CAGR 3Y/5Y/10Y*
- `tr3y` / `tr5y` / `tr10y` — cumulative 3Y/5Y/10Y figures `(1 + CAGR)^n - 1` → *TR 3Y/5Y/10Y*
- `siAnn` — since-inception annualized → *SI Ann.*
- `dividendYield` — 12-month trailing yield or indicated yield (latest distribution × frequency ÷ price)
- `secYield` — 30-day SEC yield when published; `—` otherwise

### Update controls

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `MAX_FETCHES` | all | Batch size: with a positive value the updater continues after the committed cursor in `api/ishares/update-state.json`; empty or `0` is a full pass — every fund is refreshed in one run. |
| `REQUEST_SLEEP` | `1` | Minimum delay in seconds between outgoing request starts, including retries. |
| `CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Number of parallel fund update workers. Request starts are still globally spaced by `REQUEST_SLEEP`. |
| `AUM` | `:` | Net Assets range. Each bound may be a USD amount or `K`/`M`/`B`/`T`, or one of `nano`, `micro`, `small`, `mid`, `large`. |
| `TER` | `:` | Expense ratio range in % (strict `min:max`). |
| `DIVIDEND_YIELD` | `:` | Dividend-yield percentage range. |
| `TICKERS` | all | Space-, comma- or semicolon-separated ticker allowlist, e.g. `IVV DGRO DVY HDV`. |
| `HOLDINGS_PAGE_SIZE` | `250` | Rows in each generated current-holdings JSON page. |
| `HISTORY_PAGE_SIZE` | `1000` | Rows in each generated daily-history JSON page. |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Retries after the initial request. Only network errors and HTTP 408/425/429/5xx are retried with exponential backoff. |
| `SEC_UA` | declared UA | Override the SEC User-Agent. SEC policy requires automated tools to declare a contact. |
| `SKIP_YAHOO` | off | Skip Yahoo Finance history updates. |

`TICKERS` combines with AUM, TER, yield filters using AND logic; it does not override them. Funds not selected for a successful update keep their prior published metadata and data files.

### Examples

```bash
MAX_FETCHES=10 ./scripts/update-data.ts
TICKERS="IVV DGRO DVY HDV" ./scripts/update-data.ts
AUM="1B:" TER=":0.5" ./scripts/update-data.ts
PERFORMANCE_1Y="15:" ./scripts/update-data.ts
```

## TypeScript

The browser app is intentionally build-free: `index.html` carries the markup, styles and bootstrap, and `app.tsx` is TypeScript compiled in the browser with Babel standalone — no build step, no bundler, no `tsconfig.json` needed. Bun runs TypeScript out of the box.

Verification before every publish: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun test`, and `git diff --check`.
